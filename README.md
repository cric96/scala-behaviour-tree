# Scala Behaviour Tree 

This repository contains a draft mplementation of [Behaviour Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_tree_(artificial_intelligence,_robotics_and_control)).

It is not finished and currently there isn't any plan to do so.

There is an [example](https://github.com/cric96/scala-behaviour-tree/tree/master/src/main/scala/me/vacuum) in which I briefly show how to use behaviour tree.
